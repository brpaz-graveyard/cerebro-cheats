## Usage

The plugin expects your cheat sheets to be placed in the "cheats" folder in the plugin directory.

Ex: ~/.config/Cerebro/plugins/cerebro-cheats/cheats (on Linux Systems)

Any .md, .txt, .jpg or .png placed in that directory will be available in cerebro.

The plugin can be triggered by type ```cheats``` in the cerebro box. A list of your cheat sheets will be presented and a preview of its contents for easy access.


## TODO

- [] Add support for PDF files with [pdf-js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/)
- [] Zoomable images instead of "Full Size" images.
